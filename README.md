# UFO Sightings


UFO Sightings analysis using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Chrome DevTools.


## Overview of Project

Dana is a Data journalist who choose to write about her home town, McMinnville, Oregon. What is very interesting about McMinnville, is the UFO sightings of this place. Since the data file she has is very big we are going to display it using a webpage.

The purpose of this project is to make a dynamic webpage, which accepts users input and visually adjust accordingly.  

For this we will use HTML to build the structure of the webpage, then using JavaScript we will add interactive components to filter the search based on the user input. In this case the data displayed on UFO sightings can be filtered by date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO. 
To style the webpage we will use CSS and Bootstarp. 

### Resources used:
-	Data Sources: data.js
-	Software: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Chrome DevTools.


## Results:

Here we can see the webpage when it is opened in the browser. There is a header with an image, a title and its article. Next, we have the filters to refine a search, and at the right a table with the results of the search.

To make a search using the filters you can choose to refine the search by date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO.

The results that correspond to the new search will appear in the updated table at the right. 

In the image below we can see the results of a search performed on the UFO sighting of the 1/6/2010.

## Summary:

The web page made in this project help us analyze the data we have, in a nice interface and easy to use. It is very intuitive how to perform a search with the filters on the page. 

One drawback of this webpage could be that we can´t make graphs to analyze the data. A visual representation of the data is a great way to get tons of information from the data set in one picture. 


### Additional recommendations:

•	It could be very useful to make a filter for the shape of the object seen. If the user needs to make a search using this criterion a filter of the shape could be very handy. 
•	Another recommendation is to add a message if there are not results for the criteria searched. This is to leave no doubt that the search was make and there were no results find. 
•	Also, a message to tell the user that a search criterion is not valid. For example, a date that doesn’t exist.
